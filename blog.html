      <h2><u>Thursday, March 1st 2018</u></h2>
      <h4><center>Today it was pretty awesome, world book day and I decided I wanted to go to school in my tracksuit so I went as a vampire, I got all my face fully white and it was very pale. It was pretty funny, I went to school and of course it was snowing, like it was everyday right now. It was only light snow though, it was so light that it was hardly doing anything even though it was falling down all day, but it was really cold. We all heard some rumours that we would be off school and then I asked the deputy and he said maybe. I got back home and started doing some coding then found out we were off! Sorry this was short but it is my first blog and yeah, I wanted to get started on the rest of my website so I could publish it. Thanks for reading...</center></h4>
