                    <center>All you have to do is put your mind to it, just think about it and try learn something. I
                        learnt
                        HTML in two days and fully understood it in about three days, it takes a few days for HTML, now
                        for
                        CSS maybe a little longer and then a little longer for PHP and JAVA. Eventually you will get
                        there... It takes a lot of work and fustration, it does get annoying and you have to restart
                        your
                        website around 70 million times because you need to do the layering differently and all sorts.
                        If
                        you do want help with coding and you want some notes from me or to speak to me about it please

                    <center>Today it was pretty awesome, world book day and I decided I wanted to go to school in my
                        tracksuit so I went as a vampire, I got all my face fully white and it was very pale. It was
                        pretty funny, I went to school and of course it was snowing, like it was everyday right now. It
                        was only light snow though, it was so light that it was hardly doing anything even though it was
                        falling down all day, but it was really cold. We all heard some rumours that we would be off
                        school and then I asked the deputy and he said maybe. I got back home and started doing some
                        coding then found out we were off! Sorry this was short but it is my first blog and yeah, I
                        wanted to get started on the rest of my website so I could publish it. Thanks for reading...
